                            Benefits of Studying in the USA
                        </h1>
                    </div>
                    	<p><strong>1. High Ranked Institutions:</strong></p>

<p>It’s well known that many of the best universities in the world are located in the United States of America. In fact, according to the QS World University Rankings 2015/2016, <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2015#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=">half of the top ten best universities in the world</a> are located in the US. The United States of America is home to hundreds of prestigious universities and colleges such as Harvard University, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, University of Chicago and a host of others. No matter the state in US you wish to study, you will have plenty of amazing choices to upgrade your education.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cost of Living:</strong></p>

<p>Depending on where you choose to study in the US, the cost of living can vary considerably. Living costs in the US can often be lower than those in other popular study destinations. Suburban and rural areas in the South and Midwest generally have the lowest cost of living, with big urban centers like New York City entailing considerably higher living expenses (<a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/new-york-university-nyu/">New York University</a> gives an average annual estimate of $24,000). To supplement your income, you may like to seek <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/studying-abroad/can-you-work-part-time-us-student-visa">part-time work on campus</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. Choose from a Variety of Programs:</strong></p>

<p>There are over 4,000 US universities offering undergraduate and post graduate degrees, there are various opportunities to combine various subjects as ‘majors’ and ‘minors’ in the undergraduate level.  The United States is the place you go if you want to experiment with different classes and subjects. There is no other country in the world where you can find such a diverse range of programs and flexibility as you can find in the US. You will be able to study some of the most innovative subjects and interact with well-known scholars who will guide you during your study years. The huge number of US universities and colleges also means you have many options when it comes to choosing the kind of experience you want.</p>

<p><strong>4. Extension of your F-1 Visa Status for the Optional Practical Training (OPT):</strong></p>

<p>Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a temporary employment that is directly related to an F-1 student’s major area of study. Undergraduates and graduates holding the F-1 visa are permitted by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to work for one year on a student visa towards getting practical training to complement their education. Eligible students can apply to receive up to 12 months of OPT employment authorization before completing their academic studies and/or after completing their academic studies. On March 11, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security published a final rule allowing certain F-1 students who receive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees, and who meet other specified requirements, to apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion OPT, giving STEM graduates a total of 36 months of OPT. The OPT will enable those with the student visa to receive practical training that will complement their education and also boost their curriculum vitae/resume.</p>

<p><strong>5. Improve the Prospects for your Graduate Career:</strong></p>

<p>he skills attained by studying a postgraduate degree in the US will strengthen your CV and certainly help you stand out amongst those who have obtained a postgraduate qualification from other countries. You’ll be acquiring knowledge at a higher level than what you studied during your bachelor’s degree. With a postgraduate qualification on your CV, securing a good graduate job is more likely, and the possibility of attracting a higher salary is increased. This will leave you feeling confident that the time and money invested in your postgraduate education was actually worth it.</p>

You can live on the university campus, join sports teams, clubs, and have all the amazing experiences you’ve been yearning for.</p>

<p><strong>7. More Relevance in the Job Market:</strong></p>

<p>It is a known fact that US universities have a great reputation and are well-known for the quality of their education.  Hence, it’s not surprising that companies are excited to welcome young people with US University degrees.  Companies all over the world give reference first to job seekers who have earned a degree from a University in the US compared to other countries.
