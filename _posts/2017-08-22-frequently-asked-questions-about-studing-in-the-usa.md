**1. There are so many schools in the USA, how do I decide which school to apply to?**

Choosing where and what to study in America can seem like a big project. Research your options and define your priorities. Know what you want and go for it. To help you narrow it down to the best options for you, Travcut Educational Consult offers a range of universities and degree options that reflects the wide choice on offer in USA. Our skilled and experienced advisors can talk you through your options and help you come to the best decision.

**2. Can you work while studying in the US?**

With permission of the International Student Office, international students may work on campus up to 20 hours/week in their first year and can apply to work off-campus in subsequent years. International students are allowed to work part-time during the semester and full-time during holidays, on campus. You are not allowed to work off campus until after your 1st year and then only with special permission.

**3. When will the Tuition fees be paid?**

There are schools which accept part payment of tuition fees before arrival whereas, some do no accept any payment until the student arrives at the school. We look out for those schools where you will be making payment on arrival.

**4. What’s the difference between a college and a university?**

Colleges offer mostly undergraduate degrees while universities offer undergraduate and graduate degrees, although the terms are often used interchangeably.

**Please note:** Based on our research over the years, the US embassy in Nigeria recognizes an I-20/Admission letter from a University more than a College. Visas are easily granted to students going to Universities than those going to Colleges.

**5. Can I get financial aids/scholarships to study in a University in the US?**

Many universities in the United States give out scholarships as well as financial aid that are open to international students. Scholarships are usually grants for which repayment is not required, and they are based on academic or sporting merit. All types of academic scholarships are extremely competitive and require outstanding academic records (80% aggregate). Sports Scholarships require good grades and demonstrated excellence in sport, usually at the provincial or national level. Financial aid is based on financial need, but may also be based on academic merit.

**6. How can I apply for a scholarship?**

In order for you to apply for scholarships, you will have to fill in financial aid forms for each university you apply to.  Scholarships are usually sourced from the institution at which you enroll, and not from outside bodies or philanthropies.  There is very little aid available through such (philanthropists) sources for individual applicants, and it is usually earmarked for advanced graduate (Master’s and PhD program) students.

**7. How long does it take to be accepted into an American University?**

That depends on which universities you are applying to. Some universities have earlier deadlines than others, and some have rolling admissions which means they accept applications until they are full. Universities with a regular decision deadline usually respond to students in the end of March and students must confirm their admission by May 1.

**8. What is an academic year?**

Each college and university determines its own academic year. Thus, this will vary depending on where you study. The academic year in the United States usually begins in late August or early September and continues through May or June. Each year is divided into terms. Typically, a school will have either two terms per academic year (semesters), three terms (trimesters) or four terms (quarters). Many schools divide the calendar year into four "quarters", and then designate three of those quarters (usually fall, winter, and spring) as the academic year.
