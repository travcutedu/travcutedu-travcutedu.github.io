The usual process is for students to begin the process of their admission a four to  three month  before the beginning of the US academic year so as to secure a place in the university.  Most universities only admit student at the beginning of the fall semester (also known as autumn semester) which is the beginning of the academic year.
The spring semester has duration of about 16 to 18 weeks and begins in the first to second week in Jan. Most universities require students coming in during the spring semester to have begun the processing of their admission by October  of the previous
